## Caption Tool
################################################################################

# Hello! This is Caption Tool, a simple tool for adding image and sound captions to your Ren'Py game, made by npckc (https://npckc.net)!

# Lines that begin with TODO: are sections where you may be required to do something with the code, so you can Ctrl+F TODO: to make sure you haven't missed anything.

# TODO: Please copy this file (captiontool.rpy) to the "game" folder of your game. As well, please add the following textbutton to a screen somewhere, like the Preferences screen in your screens.rpy file.

# textbutton _("Accessibility") action ShowMenu("accessibility")
# TODO: Remove the # when pasting in the preferences screen. You can also use the code in the screens.rpy file of this tool instead.

# Once you've done that, you're OK! Just edit captiontool.rpy to work with your game (e.g., add your own sound captions, change the image caption character name if necessary).

# You can take a look at script.rpy for an example of the code.

# If you use this tool, I would appreciate it if you can credit npckc (https://npckc.net or https://npckc.itch.io) or the tool in some way, but it isn't required.

# The sound and music commands follow below. Various values are mentioned, but in general they do not need to be changed. Please refer to the Ren'py documentation for more details: https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/audio.html

# This is the sound command. It functions the same way as "play sound" normally does. You can change the fadein, fadeout, loop, tight, and relative_volume values when you invoke the command. If you do not change the values, the default values are 0.0 fadein, 0.0 fadeout, false for loop, none for tight, and 1.0 relative_volume. If you change the values below, that will change the default values for every time you invoke the command.

# Add additional values afterwards if you want to change them from the default.
#(Remove the # when using it.)

# $ play_sound(beepbeep)

# You can also queue sounds with the queue command. It functions the same way as "queue sound" normally does. You can change the fadein, loop, clear_queue, tight, and relative_volume values when you invoke the command. If you do not chnage the values, the default values are 0.0 fadein, false for loop, true for clear_queue, none for tight, and 1.0 relative_volume. IF you change the values below, that will change the default values for every time you invoke the command.

# You can use "stop sound" to stop the sound played from the play sound and queue sound commands, just as you would normally.

# This is the music command. It functions the same way as "play music" normally does. You can change the fadein, fadeout, loop, synchro_start, tight, if_changed, and relative_volume values when you invoke the command. If you do not change the values, the default values are 0.0 fadein, 0.0 fadeout, none for loop, false for synchro_start, none for tight, false for if_changed, and 1.0 relative_volume.

# $ queue_music([title, hotsprings])
# $ queue_music([hotsprings, title], relative_volume=0.5)

# You can use "stop music" to stop the music played from the play music and queue music commands, just as you would normally.

# Note: By default, the play_sound command will play on the sound channel, and the play_music command will play on the music channel, but if you have custom channels, you can specify the channel in your command.

# If you use a custom channel, you will have to specify the channel when you use the stop command as well.

# Example:
# $ play_sound(ambientsound, channel='ambient')
# stop ambient

# $ play_music(rainybgm, channel='weathermusic')
# stop weathermusic

## C3: Image Captions
################################################################################

# This character, "ic", will speak if image captions or self-voicing is on. The default character name is None - that is, there is no name, like a narrator - but that can be changed.

define ic = Character(_(None),condition="persistent.image_captions or _preferences.self_voicing")

# Ren'Py also has "alt" (or "sv" in previous versions of Ren'Py), a built-in character that can be used for self-voicing. This character can be changed using config.descriptive_text_character, if you would like to use the \"alt\" character for something else.

# Example:
# define config.descriptive_text_character = "sv" << This would make the built-in self-voicing character "sv" instead, so you can use "alt" as a character elsewhere.

# You can read more about Ren'Py's built-in self-voicing options here: https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/self_voicing.html

## C4: Accessibility Menu

As this option can break the way the game is displayed and also does not support translation as of Ren'Py build 7.3.2, you may want to hide the option. The button should also be removed if your version of Ren'Py is under 7.2.2, as the menu does not exist in previous versions.
