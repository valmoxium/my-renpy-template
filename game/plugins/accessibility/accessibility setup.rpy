###Image Description
# For users who are visually impaired or otherwise use self-voicing, many times it's useful to have additional
# on screen text to compensate for effects, subtle visual changes, etc. Ren'Py has a built in character, but
# since we want the ability to see the additional text *without* activating self-voicing, we have to make our own.
# Replace all instances of "sv" (The Character) in your script with "vt".

##Whether or not to display additional text for visual effects, etc
default persistent.visual_text_help = _preferences.self_voicing

###Initial GUI preferences
#Here, we'll keep all our gui preferences, along with our persistent variables regarding accessibility.

#Audio cues
#default persistent.audio_cues = True

#Can we shake the screen/display shaking images?
default persistent.screenshake = True

##Default alpha of the say window. Append to your say screen.
default persistent.say_window_alpha = 1.0

#Used to determine what size font to use when changing font/size.
default persistent.pref_text_scale = "Default"

#Default spacing/kerning of say dialogue text. Append to your say screen.
default persistent.say_dialogue_kerning = 0

#Set your default font
#Replace all instances of gui.text_font with persistent.pref_text_font. Append to your say screen.
default persistent.pref_text_font = "fonts/StampatelloFaceto.otf"

#Set your default text size
#Replace all instances of gui.text_size with persistent.pref_text_size. Append to your say screen.

    ###Size Dictionary
    # Organized in dicts, follow the order below to create your font:size pairings.
    # Since lots of fonts use different vertical heights, it's highly recommended you include a "line_spacing" key for
    # each entry.
    # For advanced usage, if you do a font size slider you can make these minimum and maximum sizes!

    size_dict = {
        # "filepath" : {"size_scale1" : size in pixels, "size_scale2" : size in pixels...},
        # For advanced usage, you can make these dicts hold any optional arguments you want per font.
